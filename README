### CFA with a single factor

## Fit values for a CFA with a single factor can only be computed
## with models with  more than 3 observed variables.
## With 3 obeserved variables and one factor you have to compute 6 free
## parameters (with one fixed). But your covariance matrix has also 6
## nonredundant elements. Hence you get df=0 degress of freedom.
## A chi-squared distribution with df=0 is constant 0, hence we
## can expect the test statistic to be 0.
